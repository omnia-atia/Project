	Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you’ve ever cooked using a recipe 
	before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe’s author as a programmer. 
	The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!”
	And programming languages are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow. Computers “think” in binary — strings of 1s and 0s.
	 Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand and write. A programming language is made up of a series
	 of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.
